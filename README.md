# Frapp & Co. - A coffe shop business e-commerce website

A fully responsive coffee shop business website with an e-commerce section built in Javascript bootstrapped with create-react-app.

E-commerce projects can take weeks to be built, however, with Commercejs there was only need to built the frontend and use their API for everything else. The payment process was also easily implemented by Stripe.
